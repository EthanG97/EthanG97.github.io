Hi! <span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><span class="font-weight-bold">I'm Yuxiang!</span> I'm currently a 4th year PhD student at <a href='https://aiem.jhu.edu/'>AIEM</a> advised by Prof. [Rama Chellappa](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/rama-chellappa/).  I earned MS degree from [Mccormick School of Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/), [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in 2021 and BS degree from [joint program](https://www.gla.uestc.edu.cn/english/Home.htm) hosted by [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). 

My research lies in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, with a particular emphasis on Human-centered AI, Video Understanding, Multi-modal Large Language Models, and 3D Reconstruction. I had a wonderful experience as a Research Intern at [Honda Research Institute](https://usa.honda-ri.com/) (Spring 2024) mentored by Dr. [Shao-Yuan Lo](https://shaoyuanlo.github.io/); a Research Intern at [AMD GenAI](https://www.amd.com/en.html) (Summer 2025) and a student researcher at [Google](https://about.google/)

<span style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: red; font-weight: bold;">I am on the job market and actively seeking full-time research scientist/engineer opportunities starting in 2026!</span>
