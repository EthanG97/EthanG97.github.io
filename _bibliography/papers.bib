  abstract={Gait recognition holds the promise of robustly identifying subjects based on walking patterns instead of appearance information. While previous approaches have performed well for curated indoor data, they tend to underperform in unconstrained situations, e.g. in outdoor, long distance scenes, etc. We propose a framework, termed GAit DEtection and Recognition (GADER), for human authentication in challenging outdoor scenarios. Specifically, GADER leverages a Double Helical Signature to detect segments that contain human movement and builds discriminative features through a novel gait recognition method, where only frames containing gait information are used. To further enhance robustness, GADER encodes viewpoint information in its architecture, and distills representation from an auxiliary RGB recognition model, which enables GADER to learn from silhouette and RGB data at training time. At test time, GADER only infers from the silhouette modality. We evaluate our method on multiple State-of-The-Arts(SoTA) gait baselines and demonstrate consistent improvements on indoor and outdoor datasets, especially with a significant 25.2% improvement on unconstrained, remote gait data.},

  abstract={Whole-body-based human authentication is a promising approach for remote biometrics scenarios. Current literature focuses on either body recognition based on RGB images or gait recognition based on body shapes and walking patterns; both have their advantages and drawbacks. In this work, we propose Dual-Modal Ensemble (DME), which combines both RGB and silhouette data to achieve more robust performances for indoor and outdoor whole-body based recognition. Within DME, we propose GaitPattern, which is inspired by the double helical gait pattern used in traditional gait analysis. The GaitPattern contributes to robust identification performance over a large range of viewing angles. Extensive experimental results on the CASIA-B dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art recognition systems. We also provide experimental results using the newly collected BRIAR dataset.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
